# NNEClient

Client library for interacting with the "Navne & Numre Erhverv" SOAP API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nne_client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nne_client

## Usage

If you need to provide an access key configure NNE Client with:

    NNEClient.configure do |config|
      config.access_key = 'some key'
    end

Searching for a company:

    result_set = NNEClient.search(:name => 'Lokalebasen')
    result_set.first.official_name
      => "Lokalebasen.dk A/S"

So far the following keys can be used for searching:

    :houseNo (string)
    :name (string)
    :nameStartsWith (boolean)
    :street (string)
    :zipCode (number)
    :tdcId (number)

Each entry in the result\_set has the following methods available for accessing
information about the company:

    ad_protection
    cvr_no
    district
    email
    founded_year
    homepage
    number_of_employees
    official_name
    p_no
    phone
    status_text
    street
    tdf_name
    zip_code

Additionally further information can be fetched through the methods:

    additional_names
    trades
    associates
    ownerships
    subsidiaries
    finances

## Retry

As NNE can sometimes be flaky it is possible to retry requests:

    NNEClient.retry_timeouts(3) do
      ...
    end

This will retry the block up to 3 times when timeouts occur.

## Configuration

NNEClient is based on Savon and HTTPI. To disable logging with HTTPI do:

    HTTPI.log = false

To set a 5 second expiration on reads from NNE do:

    NNEClient.configure do |config|
      config.http_read_timeout = 5
    end

The NNEClient configuration can also be used to control logging:

    NNEClient.configure do |config|
      config.log = true             # enable logging (default: false)
      config.log_level = :info      # change the log level (default: :info)
      config.logger = Rails.logger  # use the Rails logger
    end

Alternatively use `with_timeout`:

    NNEClient.with_timeout(3) do
      ...
    end
